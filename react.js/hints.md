# Intro
React is a JavaScript library used to build fast, interactive user interfaces (UI) for web applications, focusing on `component-based architecture`.  

`JSX` is a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code in JavaScript, which is then compiled into standard JavaScript.

`babel`

# Functional Component
Functional components in React are JavaScript functions that return JSX and are used to build UI components.  
`Props` allow you to pass data from one component to another, enabling dynamic content in your application.
